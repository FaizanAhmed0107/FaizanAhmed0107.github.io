# My Interactive Developer Portfolio üöÄ

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio! This isn't just a list of projects; it's a fully interactive experience built with **Next.js** and brought to life with **Framer Motion**. The entire design is a nod to the developer's world: the 'About Me' section is a terminal, the 'Projects' are displayed in an IDE-like interface, and the 'Contact' form is styled as a GitHub pull request.

The portfolio is designed to be **silky-smooth**, **fully responsive**, and **data-driven**, making content updates a breeze.
